# notes

- downloaded a 2 hour Best Motivational Video 2019 Compilation my uncle sent to me (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e5SQL_xLN8)
- converted the video to mp3 using an online youtube to mp3 converter (don't remember which one)
- used audacity to create clips of mood buttons (can be downloaded at https://www.audacityteam.org/download/)
  - Had to install the LAME MP3 Encoder to export mp3s
- imported mp3 and trimmed a section I labeled why, exported, and uploaded to s3 bucket
